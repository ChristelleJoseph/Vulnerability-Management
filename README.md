# Vulnerability-Management

## Overview
The Vulnerability Management Assistant is an intelligent chatbot designed to assist in identifying and providing information on recent software vulnerabilities. This application leverages Dialogflow for natural language understanding and intent recognition, and integrates with a Flask API that fetches real-time vulnerability data from the NVD (National Vulnerability Database) and interprets it using OpenAI's GPT-3 model. The assistant is capable of understanding user queries related to recent vulnerabilities and providing detailed, actionable responses.

## Features
- **Natural Language Understanding (NLU):** Utilizes Dialogflow to recognize user intents and extract relevant information.
- **Real-Time Data Fetching:** Fetches the latest vulnerabilities from the NVD API.
- **Intelligent Analysis:** Uses OpenAI's GPT-3 to analyze and summarize vulnerabilities, providing potential impacts and mitigation steps.
- **Flexible Deployment:** Flexible Deployment: Hosted on a Flask server, this application is deployable across multiple cloud platforms for enhanced scalability and accessibility, with its current deployment being on the Google Cloud Platform

### Known Issues

Occasionally, the Dialogflow flow may not respond on the first attempt, resulting in the following error on the backend:
```
"webhookStatus": {
  "code": 4,
  "message": "Webhook call failed. Error: DEADLINE_EXCEEDED, State: URL_TIMEOUT, Reason: TIMEOUT_WEB."
}
```
This issue is related to Dialogflow's processing time exceeding the set timeout limit of 5 seconds, rather than a problem with the code itself. I've limited the NVD results to 1 and decreased the number of tokens used by the GPT model to help with faster processing time, but still, it may happen. If this happens, please wait a moment and try again.

Alternatively, you can manually trigger the webhook using the following curl command:
```
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ "queryResult": { "queryText": "Get todayâ€™s vulnerabilities", "parameters": { }, "intent": { "displayName": "FetchVulnerabilities" } } }' https://vulnerabilities-management.ue.r.appspot.com/webhook
```
